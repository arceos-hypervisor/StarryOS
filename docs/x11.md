# X11 Support

StarryOS supports X11 for GUI.

## Steps

1. Make sure you run StarryOS with necessary flags:

```bash
make img ARCH=riscv64
make run ARCH=riscv64 GRAPHIC=y INPUT=y
```

2. In StarryOS, install necessary dependencies:

```bash
apk add xorg-server xf86-video-fbdev xf86-input-evdev
```

3. Start the X server and set the DISPLAY environment variable:

```bash
X &
export DISPLAY=:0
```

4. You can now run graphical applications, for example:

```bash
apk add xcalc
xcalc
```

`dwm` is also available as a lightweight window manager.

```bash
apk add dwm
dwm &
```
